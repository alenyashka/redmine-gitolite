History
-------

There seem to be a million versions of every redmine gitolite and git hosting
plugin in existence. This can make setting up a redmine instance rather
difficult. Not only are there differing versions of the plugins but a plethora
of small bugfix branches for each version. This plugin is an attempt to pull
most of those together.

There seem to be two larger camps when it comes to gitolite integration: those
based on redmine-gitolite and those based on redmine-git-hosting. After some
careful thought (how many plugins of this type work / how many are there total)
I decided to fork redmine-gitolite. I started by merging the biggest offshoots
first (everyone can give their thanks to gdoffe for doing most of the work) and
then slowly merged the smaller bug fix branches.
